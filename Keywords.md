# Keywords
--------
1. **Blockchain**:   The decentralized and distributed ledger technology that securely records transactions across a network of computers.
2. **Cryptocurrency**:Digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates on decentralized networks, often based on blockchain.
3. **Bitcoin**:   The first and most well-known cryptocurrency, introduced by an unknown person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.
4. **Decentralization**:   The distribution of control and decision-making across a network rather than relying on a single central authority.
5. **Consensus Mechanism**:   The process by which participants in a blockchain network agree on the validity of transactions and the state of the ledger. Examples include Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).
6. **Mining**:   The process of validating transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain through computational effort. Commonly associated with PoW.
7. **Node**:   A participant in the blockchain network that maintains a copy of the entire ledger and participates in transaction validation.
8. **Immutable**:   The quality of data on the blockchain being tamper-resistant and unchangeable once confirmed and added to the ledger.
9. **Wallet** :  A digital tool or application that allows users to store, manage, and transact with their cryptocurrencies.
10. **Hash Function**:    A cryptographic function that takes an input (or message) and produces a fixed-size string of characters, typically representing a digest. A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that transforms input data into a fixed-size string of characters, called a hash value. It is deterministic, produces a unique output for each input, and is widely used for data integrity, digital signatures, password storage, and in blockchain technology for linking blocks securely.
11. **Fork**:    A split or divergence in the blockchain, resulting in two separate chains with different transaction histories.
12. **DApp** (Decentralized Application):    An application that runs on a decentralized network (blockchain) rather than a centralized server.
13. **Permissionless Blockchain**:     A blockchain where anyone can participate, validate transactions, and contribute to the network.
14. **Token**:      A unit of value issued by a project on the blockchain, often representing ownership or access rights.
15. **Private Key / Public Key**:     In asymmetric cryptography, a pair of keys used for secure communication. The private key is kept secret, while the public key is shared.
16. **SSL(secure Socket Layer)**: a deprecated cryptographic protocol that ensures secure communication over a computer network, commonly used to secure internet transactions and data transfer. It establishes a secure connection by encrypting the data exchanged between a user's web browser and a web server
17. **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)**: a widely used public-key cryptosystem for secure data transmission and digital signatures. Utilizing a pair of keys – a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Its security relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. RSA is commonly employed for secure communication, digital signatures, and securing internet connections through protocols like SSL/TLS.
18. **Elliptic curve**: Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a way to keep information safe when it travels over the internet. Instead of using long passwords, ECC uses special curves in mathematics to create a pair of keys – one public key everyone can see and one private key that's kept secret. Even though the public key is known, it's incredibly hard for someone to figure out the private key. ECC is like having a secret code that's tough to crack, making online transactions and communications secure and efficient.

## Algorithms:
- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES):
**_AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm established as a standard by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001_**.

  * Key Sizes: AES supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
  * Block Size: Operates on 128-bit blocks of data.
  * Operation: Employs a substitution-permutation network structure with a variable number of rounds (10 rounds for 128-bit keys, 12 rounds for 192-bit keys, and 14 rounds for 256-bit keys).
  * Security Features: AES is widely used and considered secure against known cryptographic attacks when using appropriate key sizes.
     * AES key - The AES key is a binary sequence of bits that determines how the encryption and decryption processes are applied. The length of the key significantly influences the security of the encryption.
- Shor's algorithm:
  * Purpose: Shor's algorithm is designed to efficiently factorize large integers into their prime factors.
  * Impact: If large-scale quantum computers are realized, Shor's algorithm would break widely used public-key cryptosystems, including RSA, by efficiently factorizing the product of large prime numbers.

*  **Encryption:** Encryption is a process that transforms information into an unreadable format using an algorithm and a key.Encryption is a process that converts readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable form (ciphertext) using an algorithm and a key. It ensures data confidentiality and security by making information inaccessible without the proper decryption key.
  * Types of encryption:
     * Symmetric encryption -
